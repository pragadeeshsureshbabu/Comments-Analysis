Online shopping is growing so fast that the global online shopping market size is predicted to hit 4 trillion in 2020. And in the US alone, we’re expecting to have 300 million online shoppers in 2023. That’s 91% of the entire country’s population!So far, 69% of Americans have shopped online, and 25% of Americans shop online at least once per month. The majority (59%) of these shoppers bought clothing items, and 47% bought their first item on Amazon.

When these people buy items on Amazon they want to get the best deal possible and know what other buyers are saying about the product. But an item listed on a website can have thousands of reviews and no one has the time to read all of them. My project takes 2 approaches -

Generating key words via topic modelling. Key words are those imortant words that the various users have used that describe their experience with product.
Summarizing the reviews for easy and faster reading
